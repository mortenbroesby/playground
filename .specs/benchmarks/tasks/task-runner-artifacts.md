query: Where does the benchmark runner build and persist results.json, report.md, and corpus.lock.json artifacts?
workflowSet: [baseline, text-first, bundle]
allowedPaths:
  - tools/ai-context-engine/bench/src/runner.ts

successCriteria:
  - the runner traces from execution to written benchmark artifacts
  - the report generator and JSON serializer stay part of the expected path
